# ⚽ Data Scraping Status

## 🔄 Currently Running:

**Backfill script is scraping 2025-26 season data**

This will take 5-10 minutes. The script is:
1. Fetching all Arsenal 2025-26 fixtures from Understat
2. Checking which matches are already in the database
3. Scraping missing matches (including Portsmouth - Jan 11)
4. Loading data into Bronze → Silver → Gold → Metrics layers

## 📊 What to Expect:

After scraping completes, you'll have:
- ✅ All 2025-26 season matches (up to Jan 11, 2026)
- ✅ Portsmouth game data
- ✅ Updated player stats
- ✅ Current season analytics

## 🎨 Meanwhile:

While the data is scraping, let me know if you want to:

1. **Start modernizing the dashboard design** (we can do this in parallel)
   - Add animations like your portfolio
   - Modern gradients and glassmorphism
   - Smooth transitions

2. **Wait for data** then test the full platform with current season

3. **Both** - I can start design work while scraping continues

**What would you prefer?** 🚀
