# Football Metrics Glossary

**Arsenal FC Analytics Platform - Comprehensive Metric Definitions**

This document provides detailed definitions, interpretations, and tactical context for all metrics used in the platform.

---

## Core Metrics

### Goals (G)
**Definition**: Balls that fully cross the goal line between the posts and under the crossbar.

**Tactical Context**:
- **Attacking metric**: Measures finishing effectiveness
- **Team vs Player**: Team goals = sum of player goals
- **Game state impact**: More goals scored when trailing (increased risk-taking)

**Limitations**:
- Doesn't measure shot quality (tap-in = long-range screamer)
- No context for opponent strength

---

### Assists (A)
**Definition**: Final pass or cross before a goal (FBref definition: pass directly leading to goal).

**Tactical Context**:
- **Creativity metric**: Measures ability to create scoring chances
- **Secondary assists** (not tracked here): Penultimate pass

**Limitations**:
- Binary outcome (assist vs no assist)
- Doesn't measure pass quality (simple square pass can be an assist)
- Dependent on teammate finishing

**Better alternatives**:
- **xA (Expected Assists)**: Accounts for shot quality created
- **xAG (Expected Assisted Goals)**: Sum of xG from assists

---

## Expected Goals (xG) Family

### xG (Expected Goals)
**Definition**: Probability (0-1) that a shot results in a goal based on historical data.

**Factors considered**:
- **Distance**: Further from goal = lower xG
- **Angle**: Narrow angle = lower xG
- **Body part**: Head = lower xG than foot
- **Situation**: Open play vs set piece
- **Assist type**: Through ball vs cross
- **Defensive pressure**: Defenders nearby = lower xG

**Models in this platform**:
- **FBref (Opta)**: Industry-standard, conservative
- **Understat**: StatsBomb-like, slightly higher values

**Interpretation**:
| xG Value | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| 0.01-0.05 | Very low quality | Long-range shot |
| 0.05-0.15 | Low quality | Tight angle shot |
| 0.15-0.35 | Medium quality | Inside box shot |
| 0.35-0.70 | High quality | 1-on-1 with keeper |
| 0.70-1.00 | Very high quality | Open goal tap-in |

**Use cases**:
1. **Performance evaluation**:
   - Arsenal scores 2 goals from 3 xG → **Underperforming** (unlucky or poor finishing)
   - Arsenal scores 2 goals from 1 xG → **Overperforming** (clinical or lucky)

2. **Sustainability analysis**:
   - Overperformance often regresses to mean (not sustainable)
   - Underperformance may indicate fixture difficulty or variance

3. **Player finishing**:
   - Saka: 10 goals from 8 xG → **+2 goals vs xG** (clinical finisher)
   - Havertz: 3 goals from 6 xG → **-3 goals vs xG** (poor finisher or unlucky)

**Limitations**:
- **Model dependent**: Different models give different values
- **Aggregation issues**: Summing xG assumes independence (not always true)
- **Contextual blindness**: Doesn't know score, time remaining, importance

---

### npxG (Non-Penalty xG)
**Definition**: xG excluding penalties.

**Why it matters**:
- Penalties have ~0.76-0.80 xG (inflates totals)
- Isolates open-play finishing quality

**Comparison**:
- **Player A**: 10 goals, 10 xG (5 from penalties) → 5 npxG, 5 penalty goals
- **Player B**: 10 goals, 10 npxG (0 penalties) → Better open-play finisher

---

### xA (Expected Assists)
**Definition**: Probability that a pass becomes an assist based on the quality of the chance created.

**Calculation**:
```
xA = Σ (xG of shots generated by player's passes)
```

**Difference from xAG**:
- **xA**: Includes passes that *could* lead to shots (broader)
- **xAG**: Only passes that *did* lead to shots (narrower)

**Example**:
- Ødegaard plays through ball to Saka
- Saka dribbles → Shoots (xG = 0.7)
- **Ødegaard's xA** = 0.7 (he created a 0.7 xG chance)

**Interpretation**:
- **High xA, low assists**: Teammates aren't finishing (unlucky)
- **Low xA, high assists**: Teammates overperforming (lucky or elite finishers)

**Use case**: Identify playmakers who create high-quality chances even if teammates don't score.

---

### xAG (Expected Assisted Goals)
**Definition**: Sum of xG values from shots directly assisted by a player.

**Formula**:
```
xAG = Σ (xG of shots that resulted from player's assists)
```

**vs xA**: xAG is retrospective (actual assists), xA is prospective (potential assists)

**Example**:
- Ødegaard assists 2 goals:
  - Goal 1: xG = 0.2 (long-range shot)
  - Goal 2: xG = 0.8 (tap-in)
- **xAG** = 1.0
- If both were *assists* but not goals, xA would still be 1.0

**Use case**: Measure quality of assists (assisting tap-ins vs assisting screamers)

---

### PSxG (Post-Shot xG / xGOT - Expected Goals On Target)
**Definition**: Probability a shot results in a goal *after accounting for shot placement*.

**Factors**:
- **xG factors** (distance, angle, body part)
- **Shot placement** (top corner vs center, power vs finesse)

**Formula**:
```
PSxG = xG + adjustment for shot quality
```

**Use cases**:

1. **Goalkeeper evaluation**:
   - **Ramsdale**: 20 goals conceded, 15 PSxG → **-5 goals vs PSxG** (poor shot-stopping)
   - **Raya**: 10 goals conceded, 15 PSxG → **+5 goals vs PSxG** (excellent shot-stopping)

2. **Finishing quality**:
   - **Havertz**: xG = 5.0, PSxG = 6.5 → **+1.5** (placing shots well, good technique)
   - **Nketiah**: xG = 5.0, PSxG = 4.0 → **-1.0** (poor shot placement)

**Interpretation**:
- **PSxG > xG**: Shooter placing shots well (top corner, low, etc.)
- **PSxG < xG**: Shooter hitting straight at keeper or poor placement

**Data source**: FBref (reported as PSxG-xG per 90)

---

## Expected Threat (xT)

### xT (Expected Threat)
**Definition**: Increase in probability of scoring by moving the ball from one pitch zone to another.

**Methodology**:
1. **Grid creation**: Pitch divided into 12x8 zones (96 total)
2. **Probability assignment**: Each zone has P(goal | possession here)
   - Based on historical shot data (where shots taken, conversion rate)
3. **xT calculation**: `xT = P(goal | zone_end) - P(goal | zone_start)`

**Example zones** (approximate values):
| Zone | P(goal) | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| Own penalty area | 0.02 | Deep defense |
| Midfield center | 0.08 | Central midfield |
| Final third wing | 0.15 | Wide attacking |
| Opponent penalty area | 0.40 | Central box |
| 6-yard box | 0.75 | Tap-in zone |

**Example calculation**:
- **Pass**: Midfield (P=0.08) → Final third (P=0.20)
  - **xT** = 0.20 - 0.08 = **0.12**
- **Carry**: Final third (P=0.20) → Penalty area (P=0.50)
  - **xT** = 0.50 - 0.20 = **0.30**

**Use cases**:

1. **Identify progressive players**:
   - **Declan Rice**: High xT from carries (deep to midfield)
   - **Ødegaard**: High xT from passes (midfield to box)

2. **Evaluate possession value**:
   - Not all passes equal (backward pass = negative xT)
   - Possession ≠ threat (sideways passing = ~0 xT)

3. **Tactical analysis**:
   - Team xT from carries → Direct style (dribbling through lines)
   - Team xT from passes → Possession style (passing through lines)

**Limitations**:
- **No defensive pressure**: Open space vs crowded box (same xT)
- **No game state**: Doesn't know if trailing (higher risk tolerance)
- **No sequence context**: Doesn't credit buildup beyond single action

**Alternatives**:
- **OBV (On-Ball Value)**: StatsBomb's proprietary model (accounts for pressure, game state)
- **VAEP (Valuing Actions by Estimating Probabilities)**: Academic alternative

## Progressive Actions

### Progressive Pass
**Definition**: Pass that moves the ball **≥10 yards toward opponent's goal** OR into the penalty area.

**FBref criteria** (used in this platform):
1. Distance: ≥10 yards closer to goal
2. Direction: Toward goal (not sideways/backward)
3. Special case: Any pass into penalty area counts

**Examples**:
- ✓ Center-back to midfielder (15 yards forward)
- ✓ Through ball into penalty area (5 yards but into box)
- ✗ Sideways pass across midfield (0 yards toward goal)
- ✗ Backward pass to goalkeeper (negative progress)

**Tactical interpretation**:
- **High progressive passes**: Team bypasses opponent press
- **Low progressive passes**: Team struggles to advance ball (opponent's deep block)

**Position-specific**:
- **Defenders** (Saliba, Gabriel): Progressive passes = ball-playing ability
- **Midfielders** (Rice, Ødegaard): Progressive passes = chance creation
- **Forwards**: Progressive passes less common (already advanced)

---

### Progressive Carry
**Definition**: Dribble/run that moves the ball **≥5 yards toward opponent's goal** OR into the penalty area.

**FBref criteria**:
1. Distance: ≥5 yards closer to goal (lower threshold than passes)
2. Possession maintained (not a pass, not lost)
3. Special case: Any carry into penalty area counts

**Examples**:
- ✓ Saka dribbling from wing toward box (8 yards)
- ✓ Rice carrying from deep midfield (12 yards)
- ✗ Martinelli running sideways along touchline (0 yards toward goal)

**Tactical interpretation**:
- **High progressive carries**: Press-resistant players, ball carriers
- **Low progressive carries**: Team relies on passing (not dribbling)

**Use case**:
- **Declan Rice**: High progressive carries → Ball progression without risky passes
- **Bukayo Saka**: High progressive carries → Beats defenders 1v1

**Comparison to xT**:
- Progressive carry = binary (yes/no, ≥5 yards)
- xT carry = continuous (value depends on start/end zones)

---

### Progressive Distance
**Definition**: Total yards carried toward opponent's goal.

**Calculation**:
```
Progressive distance = Σ (carry distance * direction_toward_goal)
```

**Use case**: Measure ball progression volume (not just frequency)

---

## Shot & Goal Creating Actions

### SCA (Shot-Creating Action)
**Definition**: **Two** offensive actions directly leading to a shot (regardless of outcome).

**Action types**:
1. **PassLive**: Live-ball pass
2. **PassDead**: Free kick, corner kick
3. **Dribble**: Successful dribble
4. **Shot**: Shot deflected to teammate
5. **Foul Drawn**: Free kick in dangerous area
6. **Defensive Action**: Tackle/interception leading to shot

**Examples**:

**Example 1**:
- Ødegaard dribbles past defender → Passes to Saka → Saka shoots
- **SCA** = **2** (dribble + pass)
- Credited to: **Ødegaard** (both actions)

**Example 2**:
- Rice wins tackle → Passes to Martinelli → Martinelli shoots
- **SCA** = **2** (defensive action + pass)
- Credited to: **Rice** (2 SCAs)

**Interpretation**:
- **High SCA**: Directly involved in chance creation
- **SCA vs Assists**: SCA credits buildup, not just final pass

**Limitation**: Arbitrary 2-action window
- Doesn't credit 3rd-to-last pass (e.g., Rice → Ødegaard → Saka → Shot)
- Better alternative: **Pass sequences** (tracks full buildup)

---

### GCA (Goal-Creating Action)
**Definition**: SCA where the shot results in a **goal**.

**Relationship**:
```
GCA ⊆ SCA  (all GCA are SCA, but not all SCA are GCA)
```

**Interpretation**:
- **High GCA**: Directly involved in goals (not just chances)
- **GCA rate**: GCA / SCA (conversion rate of created chances)

**Example**:
- **Ødegaard**: 50 SCA, 10 GCA → **20% GCA rate**
- **Havertz**: 30 SCA, 3 GCA → **10% GCA rate**

**Use case**: Identify players who create goals (not just shots)

---

## Passing Metrics

### Key Pass
**Definition**: Final pass before a shot (regardless of whether shot scored).

**Relationship to assists**:
```
Assists ⊆ Key Passes  (all assists are key passes, but not all key passes are assists)
```

**Example**:
- Ødegaard passes to Saka → Saka shoots (saved) → **Key pass** (not assist)
- Ødegaard passes to Saka → Saka shoots (goal) → **Key pass AND assist**

**Limitation**: Doesn't measure shot quality
- Key pass leading to 0.01 xG shot = same as 0.90 xG shot

**Better metric**: **xA** (accounts for shot quality)

---

### Pass Completion %
**Definition**: (Passes completed / Passes attempted) × 100

**Tactical context**:
- **High %**: Safe passing, risk-averse
- **Low %**: Risky passing, attempting difficult balls

**Position-specific benchmarks**:
| Position | Typical % | Arsenal Players |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|
| Center-back | 90-95% | Saliba, Gabriel |
| Defensive mid | 85-92% | Rice, Jorginho |
| Attacking mid | 75-88% | Ødegaard, Havertz |
| Winger | 70-85% | Saka, Martinelli |

**Limitation**: Doesn't account for pass difficulty
- 5-yard sideways pass = easier than 40-yard through ball

---

### Passes into Final Third
**Definition**: Number of passes that end in the attacking final third.

**Tactical use**: Measure ability to advance ball into dangerous areas

---

### Passes into Penalty Area
**Definition**: Number of passes that end in the opponent's penalty area.

**Tactical use**: Measure ability to penetrate defense

**Comparison**:
- **Key passes**: Final pass before shot (outcome-focused)
- **Passes into box**: Any pass into box (volume-focused)

---

## Possession Metrics

### Touches
**Definition**: Number of times a player touches the ball.

**Interpretation**:
- **High touches**: Central to team's play, heavily involved
- **Low touches**: Peripheral role or limited minutes

**Position-specific**:
- **Midfielders**: Highest touches (receive ball frequently)
- **Strikers**: Lower touches (fewer passing options)

**Limitation**: Doesn't measure *quality* of touches

---

### Carries
**Definition**: Number of times a player moves ≥5 yards with the ball.

**vs Dribbles**:
- **Carry**: Running with ball in space
- **Dribble**: Beating a defender

**Use case**: Measure ball progression through carries (not passes)

---

## Dribbling Metrics

### Dribbles Completed
**Definition**: Number of successful dribbles past an opponent.

**Success criteria**: Maintain possession after beating defender

---

### Dribbles Attempted
**Definition**: Total dribble attempts (successful + unsuccessful).

---

### Dribble Success %
**Definition**: (Dribbles completed / Dribbles attempted) × 100

**Interpretation**:
- **High %** (>70%): Effective dribbler, picks moments wisely
- **Low %** (<50%): Loses ball frequently, risky style

**Position-specific**:
| Position | Typical % | Arsenal Players |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|
| Winger | 55-75% | Saka, Martinelli |
| Attacking mid | 60-80% | Ødegaard |
| Full-back | 50-70% | Timber, Zinchenko |

**Tactical trade-off**:
- **High volume, low %**: Risk-taking style (acceptable for wingers)
- **Low volume, high %**: Conservative style (safe possession)

---

## Defensive Metrics

### Tackles
**Definition**: Number of times a player dispossesses an opponent.

**Types** (not separated in this platform):
- **Tackles won**: Successful dispossession
- **Tackles lost**: Opponent maintains possession

---

### Interceptions
**Definition**: Number of times a player intercepts a pass.

**vs Tackles**:
- **Interception**: Read the game, intercept pass (proactive)
- **Tackle**: React to opponent dribbling (reactive)

**Tactical interpretation**:
- **High interceptions**: Positional intelligence (e.g., Saliba)
- **High tackles**: Aggressive pressing (e.g., Rice)

---

### Blocks
**Definition**: Number of times a player blocks a shot or pass with body.

**Use case**: Defensive commitment, shot-blocking ability

---

### Clearances
**Definition**: Number of times a player kicks ball away from danger.

**Tactical context**:
- **High clearances**: Under pressure, defensive team
- **Low clearances**: Possession-based, ball-playing defense

---

## Game State Metrics

### Minutes Leading/Drawing/Trailing
**Definition**: Cumulative time (minutes) spent in each game state during a match.

**Calculation**:
```
For each minute:
  If Arsenal score > Opponent score: minutes_leading += 1
  If Arsenal score = Opponent score: minutes_drawing += 1
  If Arsenal score < Opponent score: minutes_trailing += 1
```

**Use case**: Context-adjust performance metrics

**Example**:
- Arsenal 2-1 win (scored in 30th minute, opponent equalized 60th, Arsenal winner 80th)
  - **Minutes leading**: 30 (30th-60th) + 10 (80th-90th) = 40 minutes
  - **Minutes drawing**: 30 (0-30th) + 20 (60th-80th) = 50 minutes
  - **Minutes trailing**: 0 minutes

**Tactical impact**:
| Game State | Tactical Behavior | Expected Metrics |
|------------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Leading** | Defensive, conservative | Lower xG, fewer shots, more long balls |
| **Drawing** | Balanced | Moderate xG, balanced play |
| **Trailing** | Aggressive, risky | Higher xG, more shots, progressive actions |

**Dashboard use**: Show xG/shots per 90 split by game state

---

## Per-90 Metrics

### Goals per 90
**Formula**: `(Goals / Minutes played) × 90`

**Why per-90?**: Normalizes for playing time
- Player A: 10 goals in 1800 minutes = **0.50 goals per 90**
- Player B: 5 goals in 450 minutes = **1.00 goals per 90** (better rate!)

**Minimum threshold**: Typically 500-900 minutes (to filter low-sample players)

---

### xG per 90, xA per 90, etc.
**Same formula**: `(Metric / Minutes played) × 90`

**Use case**: Compare players with different minutes (starters vs substitutes)
